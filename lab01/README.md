# CS 262 - Lab 1

This lab is based on the basic [hello-world Expo app](https://expo.io/learn)

Answers to the lab questions:
*App.js contains the project code to display "Hello Expo!"
*package.json contains project information, tracks dependencies and scripts
*node_modules contains the necessary packages and dependencies for the app.
*.gitignore is used for version control so git knows which files to track or not track.
